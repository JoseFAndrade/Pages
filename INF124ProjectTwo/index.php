      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
          Here at Brew Growth, we are dedicated to helping customers find their right coffee needs. We offer a wide variety of different machines which all make coffee differently 
        so you can be sure one of them can suit your palette. Because of how unique each machine functions, the taste will differ as well. Whether you want a good slow roast or
        you in a rush and need to pop a pod in, you can be sure we have the right product for you. In addition, we also sell coffee bags just so you can enjoy a different taste
        once in a while.
      </p>
