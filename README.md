    -For some reason the main website kept on crashing on us when startup. We tried to see how other kids solved it on piazza, but that
    didn't work for us.

On first load, the website goes to the home page where there is a short description of the company and who worked on this project.
There are 3 navigation tabs on the top left where you can find the different products tables on this site. Clicking on the images
will take you to each individual product pages. The order form for each product is located on the bottom of each page.
